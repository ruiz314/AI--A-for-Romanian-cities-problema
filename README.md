# AI-A*-for-Romanian-cities-problem
Comparison between A* for Romanian cities problem, using f(n)=a*g(n) + b*h(n) for different values of a and b. Try a, b in {0.2 ,—è 0.5 , 0.7 , 1 , 1.2 , 1.5 , 2}. You will thus have 49 combinations and we are interested in the number of nodes developed (you will count them and save them in a text file in CSV format).

- romania_map.h contains all city and heuristic data.
- astar.cpp handle the algorithm, manages input, output, and the main program logic.
